    Implement Dynamic Programming algorithm in C++ under the hood for optimal results!
    Algorithm examines a given ensemble of documents relative to a query vector, and  
    determines the optimal combination of documents with the highest context relevance

    This achieves two things:
    1. Provides a concise context for performing RAG with an LLM, thereby generating accurate
    responses with low probability of hallucination 
    2. Rapidly improves response times by implementing DP algorithm in C++!

In antiquity, the nomadic Scythians inhabited the land, and the Achaemenid Persian Empire expanded towards the southern region. Turkic nomads have inhabited the country from as early as the 6th century. In the 13th century, the territory was subjugated by the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan. In the 15th century, as a result of disintegration of the Golden Horde, the Kazakh Khanate was established. By the 18th century, Kazakh Khanate disintegrated into three j√ºz which were absorbed and conquered by the Russian Empire; by the mid-19th century, the Russians nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the Russian Empire and liberated the slaves of the Kazakhs in 1859.[14] Following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War, the territory was reorganized several times. In 1936, it was established as the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic within the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan was the last of the Soviet republics to declare independence during the dissolution of the Soviet Union from 1988 to 1991. '
